Development Guidelines
======================

Reporting issues
----------------

If you find a bug or want to suggest a new feature, please report it on the
`GitHub issues page <https://github.com/crusaderky/pyscenarios/issues>`_.

Before you report an issue, please check if it can still be reproduced with the
latest version of this software.

For bug reports, please include the following information:

- A description of the bug
- The expected behavior
- The actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce the bug (preferably with a minimal example)
- Any relevant error messages or stack traces


Deploying a development environment
-----------------------------------

1. Clone this repository with git:

.. code-block:: bash

     git clone git@github.com:crusaderky/pyscenarios.git
     cd pyscenarios

2. `Install pixi <https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation>`_
3. To keep a fork in sync with the upstream source:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd pyscenarios
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:crusaderky/pyscenarios.git
   git remote -v
   git fetch -a upstream
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git push origin main


Test
----

Test using pixi:

.. code-block:: bash

   pixi run tests

Test with coverage:

.. code-block:: bash

   pixi run coverage

Test with coverage and open HTML report in your browser:

.. code-block:: bash

   pixi run open-coverage


Code Formatting
---------------

This project uses several code linters (ruff, mypy, etc.), which are enforced by
CI. Developers should run them locally before they submit a PR, through the single
command

.. code-block:: bash

    pixi run lint

Optionally, you may wish to run the linters automatically every time you make a
git commit. This can be done by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   pixi run install-git-hooks

Now the code linters will be run each time you commit changes.
You can skip these checks with ``git commit --no-verify`` or with
the short version ``git commit -n``.


Documentation
-------------

Build the documentation in ``build/html`` using pixi:

.. code-block:: bash

    pixi run docs

Build the documentation and open it in your browser:

.. code-block:: bash

    pixi run open-docs
